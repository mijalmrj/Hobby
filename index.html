                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p><em>I'm <strong>Mijal Maharjan</strong>, <strong>22</strong> years old, and I really love gaming, watching anime and movies, and listening to music. Games let me be whoever I want, movies and anime tell awesome stories, and music keeps me company all day. I enjoy diving into digital adventures where every click leads to something new and exciting. </em> </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p><em>Arriving in <strong>Australia</strong> from <strong>Nepal</strong> was a leap into the unknown, but it's been a journey filled with achievements. Becoming independent and earning for myself has been incredibly empowering. <u>Securing a job</u> in the hospitality sector was a significant milestone, reflecting my dedication and adaptability in a new country. One of my proudest achievements has been making friends from diverse backgrounds. Connecting with people from various cultures has broadened my perspective and enriched my life in ways I never imagined. These achievements fuel my determination to continue thriving in this new chapter of my life. </em></p>

                        <em>Looking ahead, my goals for the future are crystal clear and deeply motivating. Graduating with a decent score is not just about earning a piece of paper; it's a testament to my hard work and dedication. My ultimate aim is to find a job in the IT sector, where I can apply my skills and knowledge to make a meaningful impact. Alongside this, I aspire to earn enough money to support myself comfortably and achieve financial stability. Owning a car is more than just a convenience; it represents a milestone of independence and mobility.<strong> But above all, one of my greatest aspirations is to make my parents proud.</strong> Their unwavering support and sacrifices have fueled my journey, and I'm determined to repay their faith by achieving success and happiness in all that I do. </em></p>
